# Neural_Networks_Reuters_Newswires
You are asked to develop a neural network model to classify Reuters newswires into one of the 46 different mutually-exclusive topics. Each sample (news) belongs to one and only one category. 
The words in the train and test datasets are already encoded into numbers (similar to our IMDb example). Each sample is a list of integers (word indices), thus has a different length.
